			<p id="imdave">Hi, I'm David</p>
			<p id="thanks">Thanks for stopping by.</p>
			<p>I guess I can best describe myself as a sports-loving nerd, who gets a thrill out of learning something new. Now not all things interest me, but if it fascinates me, I'm all in.</p> 
			<p>I enjoy observing life through my third lense</p>

				<h4>Here are some fun facts about me:</h4>

				
					<p>I'm a New York Mets fan to the core.</p>
					<p>Born and raised in Brooklyn N.Y. and miss it alot.</p>
					<p>I once uncovered a Russian fraud and money-laundering scam.</p>
					<p>I'm a pretty good cook, believe me.</p>
					<p>I once did the macarena at one fund-raiser, and the electric slide at another.</p>

			<p>My goal is to be essential part of a organization, assisting in attaining its goals. This organization is willing to take chance on me to use my experience, my tools, and myself to succeed. This organization feeds my need for knowledge, and allows me to work with motivated and creative people. They encourage 	diversity, teamwork and inclusion.</p>
			<p>If you ever discuss my professional aptitude and how I can fit in your organization, or more personal things like your thoughts on 90's rap music versus today's, or your favorite tourist spot in Barcelona, choose <a href="mailto:dortiz1123@hotmail.com">PEACE.</a></p>

		<p id="passion">Sometimes interests can turn into hobbies, while others become passing fads. Your favorites become passions. Passion can make you love what you do and who you are. It can make you seek knowledge. It can make you productive. It can make you enjoy life.</p>
