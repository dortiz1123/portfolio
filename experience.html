		<h1 id="experiencetitle">An Accounting of My Professional Life</h1>
			<section id="experiences">

					<h3 >Right to Work</h3>
						<p>My workplace experiences began with various jobs like a shop mechanic at an HVAC company, an ice scooper at Baskin- Robbins, a bouncer at a local bar, and a salesperson at a sporting goods store. I acquired many skills while employed at these establishments, but one major interest; how do I run a business? I thought "What career would allow me to view the total operations of a business from all sides"? Accounting.</p>

						<p>I always thought accountants have the best view, an aggregate view, of all businesses. Through financial analysis, accountants can tell you about the inner-workings of any enterprise. Accountants are both historians and fortune tellers. They have the ability to use past facts to make current decision with hopes of a specific future outcome. The numbers tell a story.</p>

					<h3>Acquiring Assets</h3>
						<p>I started my accounting career at a small CPA firm in "The Diamond District" in New York City.  As one can presume, most of our clients were local jewelry retailers and manufacturers in the area. Here I learned about what is necessary to open a business. I learned the importance of submitting the proper filings and obtaining the mandatory certifications to operate a business in a certain state. Also I learn bookkeeping, and itâ€™s usefulness to the success of a business. I also learned terms like organizational skills and time-management. I became an effective worker.This experience prompted me to explore more and register for classes at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.</p>
		
						<p>While at the CPA firm, I saw an opportunity to join the National Hemophilia Foundation, and learn the similarities and differences of a company, whose main purpose is to serve its constituents, as opposed to making a profit. Here, I gained many of those intangibles that not only make you a sharp teammate, but a great human being. NHF taught me the importance of community, diversity, team and tolerance. I felt like my work had a greater purpose than just the numbers. I really believe everyone should work for a charitable organization once in their lifetime.</p>

					<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
						<p>My biggest challenge in my pursuit for knowledge was to change my career direction. I decided to aim for a Bachelor's degree in sport management of all things. As an avid fan, and sometimes participant, I experience all the emotional and entertainment aspect of sport. I figured why not learn more about sports from a business perspective, and I went all-in.</p> 
				 
						<p>I started classes at Post University through their online teaching platform. At the same time, I planned the creation of a new business venture, Sharp Edge Sports Collectibles LLC  (a passion project), and began implementing my plan. It's a continued work in progress, but it's also a great learning experience. I'm currently learning HTML5 and CSS in order to build a functional and efficient website for Sharp Edge and of course, this website you're reading now. It's the hardest job I ever had, but the most gratifying.</p>

					<h3>Forecast</h3>
						<p>I've discovered the secret to being successful; do something you love and what makes you happy. My pursuit to happiness is continuous, because learning things and applying my knowledge to the success of my project and other potential employers is something I truly enjoy.</p>

						<p>I'm currently seeking an internship in the sports and entertainment industry. Completion of this internship will allow me to cross off an item from my list of personal goals; a bachelor's degree.</p>

						<p>My ideal job would be to work in New York Mets front office, but for now, this is just a target. I'm willing and able to share my wisdom and competence to any enterprise who encourage employee input and feedback. One that gives back to its community, and has created a culture where teamwork and purpose are keys to success where everyone benefits.</p>
